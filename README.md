# agentic-ai-backend
Tool-augmented LLM agent using Groq and Python
A simple LLM-powered agentic system built in Python and Colab using Groq's LLaMA-3 model. The agent can:
- Generate and execute code from natural language prompts
- Monitor stock prices and trigger alerts
- Perform tool-based reasoning

## How It Works

1. User provides a task (e.g., "Calculate sum of exponential of Fibonacci numbers")
2. The system queries Groq LLM â†’ returns Python code
3. The code is executed securely in Colab
4. Supports API integration, email alerts, and agentic extensions

## Tech Stack

- Python, Google Colab
- Groq API (LLaMA-3 70B)
- Requests, smtplib, yfinance, etc.

## Example

```python
prompt = "Calculate sum of exponential of first 6 Fibonacci numbers"
# Groq will return:
# import math
# fib = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
# print(sum([math.exp(x) for x in fib]))
